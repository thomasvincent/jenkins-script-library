Last tested: May 9, 2025

## Test Matrix

| Java Version | Jenkins LTS | Build Status | Notes |
|--------------|-------------|--------------|-------|
| Java 8       | 2.249.3     | ✅ Pass      | Tested on MacOS with Zulu 8.86.0.25 |
| Java 11      | 2.387.3     | -            | *Run Docker test to update* |
| Java 17      | 2.387.3     | -            | *Run Docker test to update* |

## Known Issues and Limitations

- Some cloud provider classes are excluded due to missing dependencies
- XML processing dependencies may need additional configuration
- Integration tests are currently disabled

## Excluded Components

The following components are temporarily excluded from the build to ensure compatibility across environments:

1. Cloud provider integration (`**/cloud/**`)
2. Job configuration audit (`**/JobConfigAuditor.groovy`)
3. Job migration (`**/JobMigrator.groovy`) 
4. Job dependency management (`**/JobDependencyManager.groovy`)
5. Job health analysis (`**/JobHealthAnalyzer.groovy`)
6. Job parameter management (`**/JobParameterManager.groovy`)
7. Job templates (`**/JobTemplate.groovy`)
8. All integration tests

## Features Tested

### 1. Job Management
- ✅ Job build history cleaning
- ✅ Job disabling
- ✅ Build number management

### 2. Node Management
- ✅ Slave node listing
- ✅ Offline slave node detection
- ✅ Slave node starting

### 3. Security Features
- ✅ Security configuration auditing
- ✅ User management
- ✅ API token verification

### 4. Configuration Management
- ✅ Jenkins configuration backup
- ✅ Job configuration backup
- ✅ Plugin configuration backup

### 5. Helm Integration
- ✅ Helm installation management
- ✅ Helm version detection
- ✅ Helm tool configuration

## Next Steps

1. Add the required plugin dependencies to enable excluded components
2. Implement proper XML handling for all Java versions
3. Update integration tests to work with different Jenkins versions
