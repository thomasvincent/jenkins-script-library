# Jenkins scripts
This repository contains a collection of scripts for Jenkins. The scripts are written in Groovy and can be used to automate tasks such as:

* Starting and stopping Jenkins jobs
* Building and deploying applications
* Managing Jenkins resources

The scripts are organized into the following directories:

**jobs**: Contains scripts for starting and stopping Jenkins jobs
**build**: Contains scripts for building and deploying applications
**resources**: Contains scripts for managing Jenkins resources

To use the scripts, you will need to install Groovy and the Jenkins CLI. Once you have installed the necessary software, you can run the scripts by using the groovy command.

For example, to start the MyJob job, you would run the following command:

`groovy jobs/start-job.groovy MyJob`
